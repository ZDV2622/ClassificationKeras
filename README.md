# ClassificationKeras

Project, wich will be added here, is example how to solve multi-lable classification(>40000 classes) for text data.

Example, where it was implemented:

We had database, with more than 40000 products. We had task to analize data from different sources. To solve this problem, it was needed to match text product names from different sources with our DB. As input dataset, we had some amount of examples, matched by barcodes. Using it for training, we acheived >70% successfull classification.

Code, and more detail description will be here as soon..
